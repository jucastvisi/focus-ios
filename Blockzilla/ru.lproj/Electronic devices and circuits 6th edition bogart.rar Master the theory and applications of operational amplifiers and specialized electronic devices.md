Electronic Devices and Circuits is a textbook written by T.F. Bogart, Jeffrey S. Beasley and Guillermo Rico, published by Pearson Education in 2004. It covers the theory and applications of electronic devices and circuits, with an emphasis on integrated circuit design, operational amplifiers and specialized devices such as switching regulators and optoelectronics.
 
The book is divided into 18 chapters, each with objectives, key terms, review questions and problems. The chapters are organized into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts of electronic devices and circuits, such as semiconductor materials, diodes, transistors and biasing techniques. Part II covers the analysis and design of analog integrated circuits, such as operational amplifiers, feedback circuits, filters and oscillators. Part III deals with the principles and applications of digital integrated circuits, such as logic gates, flip-flops, counters and memory devices. Part IV explores some advanced topics in electronic devices and circuits, such as power amplifiers, switching regulators, optoelectronics and microcontrollers.

Electronic Devices and Circuits is a comprehensive and up-to-date textbook that can serve as a valuable reference for students and professionals alike who are interested in learning more about the theory and practice of electronic devices and circuits.

To illustrate some of the topics covered in the book, here are some excerpts from the chapters:
 
- Chapter 3: Diode Circuits. "A diode is a two-terminal device that allows current to flow in one direction only. The symbol for a diode is shown in Figure 3.1. The arrow points in the direction of conventional current flow when the diode is forward biased. The end of the diode opposite the arrow is called the cathode and is marked with a bar. The end with the arrow is called the anode."
- Chapter 9: Operational Amplifiers. "An operational amplifier (op amp) is a high-gain, direct-coupled amplifier with two input terminals and one output terminal. The input terminals are labeled as inverting (-) and noninverting (+), and the output terminal is labeled as Vout. The symbol for an op amp is shown in Figure 9.1. An op amp can perform a variety of mathematical operations on its input signals, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, integration and differentiation."
- Chapter 14: Logic Families. "A logic family is a group of integrated circuits that have compatible electrical characteristics and use the same logic levels and voltage supply. There are many different logic families, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of speed, power consumption, noise immunity and cost. Some of the most common logic families are transistor-transistor logic (TTL), complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and emitter-coupled logic (ECL)."
- Chapter 18: Microcontrollers. "A microcontroller is a single-chip computer that contains a central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output (I/O) ports and other peripherals. A microcontroller can be programmed to perform specific tasks by using a high-level language such as C or assembly language. Microcontrollers are widely used in embedded systems, such as appliances, automobiles, robots and toys."

The book also provides appendices on data sheets, SPICE simulation software, number systems and codes, and answers to selected problems.
